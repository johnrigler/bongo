part of the Web3 experience.

This is a proving ground for my hashStack idea. Basically, you create the stack by getting an hash of a hash of a hash. The final hash that you generate is used first. So this truly is a stack, although you must read it from end to beginning. No one wins any points on a round unless they have provided a hash which is the "root" (not sure of the
terminology) of the previously presented hash. Right now, this is all the game does. Your score increases 
based on your hash plus the hash of the previous block. This is where any Sybil shenanigans would come into play.
Let's track down that madness. But because you are locked into the next value that you must give, an attack could
only be a skipped turn. Because turns are no longer tied to metamask, it is quite easy to get them all into the same
block. This is my response to Keir Finlow-Bates, who has graciously given me a critique of my ideas so far. Follow him and his buddies on LinkedIn--- do it now.
